#COPD_MCA_PCA_AHC


#In the file R_code, we provide the code used for the analysis of the COPD cohort study.

#Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Agglomerative Hoerarchical Clustering using Ward.D2 method.

#All the code is written in R.

#Libraries used provided in Step0_libraries file.

#For the Results section;


#NOTE: BEFORE RUN ANY CODE, FIRST RUN THE Step0_libraries



#1.Research Cohort Creation-->Castalbi_et_all_pca_article

#2.In order to obtain the final cluster run the following starting from Step1, Step2, until Step5


#Individuals and Co-variates-->Step1_Final_manip

#Simple Explanatory Analysis-->Step1_Final_manip

#Multiple Correspondence Analysis-->Step2_Final_mca_drugs+dis

#Principal Components Analysis-->STEP3_Final_pca_cont

#Case Study 1 & Case Study 2-->STEP4_Final_ahc, Step4ii_Final_HCindex-
#wss_for_clusters_from_Practical_Data_Science_with_R_Zumel_Mount,
#Step5_Final_interval calculation

#NOTE: FOR THE HC INDEX WE USED THE CODE OF ZUMEL AND MOUNT AS THEY PROVIDED IN THEIR BOOK "PRACTICAL DATA SCIENCE WITH R"
